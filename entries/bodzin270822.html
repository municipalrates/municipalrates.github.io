        <p>He's not the only one, but Stephan Bodzin has a unique synth tone. I haven't tracked back to locate its origins, or its evolution, but I imagine him rearing and taming it like a wolfhound over many smoky decades, taking it for wild, meandering walks through the tundra. </p>

        <p>Once you've found your synthetic groove, giving it space to wander and bound must hold some exhilaration, like coming across a weak but friendly god in the woodworking shed.</p>

        <p>There are videos of Bodzin performing in alpine resorts, draped in mountain mist, exhalations of Bacardi, cool and very cold, his lead line baying without the need for a pack, just an audience, ampage, and all of it seen through a drone-lifted lens.</p>
