        <p>It doesn't feel like it would be possible, but it's raining.</p> 
        
        <p>Cars go past in bubbles, thin tabs of white and yellow coming one way, red going the other. In the distance, just visible between sodden, evenly-planted trees, the red lights gather briefly, like a temporary barricade, paused at a junction, then sputter onwards to be replaced by others.</p>

        <p>There are a range of sounds here - the air conditioning, the fan, the music on the wireless speaker, the passing of wheels in the rain, the rain itself. At times it all combines, or I will it to combine, into something that sounds vaguely like deep breathing, or the breathing of a being that's like us in some ways, but larger, more gentle, a bit docile, or perhaps softly drugged.</p>

        <p>Just like the rain, the cars keep regenerating. If I were to sit here long enough, some of them would surely repeat. Even the raindrops, if given enough time, could eventually reappear; the same water, just in a recycled form, impossible to catch each time it comes around.</p>
