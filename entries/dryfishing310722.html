    <div class="mainentry">
        <p>Out on the edges, beyond the newest line of fencing, there were cracks in the earth from drought.</p>
        <p>Big enough to peer into, as one would a continent. Big enough to glimpse different potentials for living, varied animals and stitch patterns.</p>
        <p>People went there to draw up inspiration or, at the very least, useable smog. They got only thin remnants of tendon, once belonging to something thirsty and something else.</p>
        <p>Imagine a dead hare merged with the bird that stripped it. Road kill and vulture, rolled into one. That's the sort of fun being dredged.</p>
        <p>No one, not even the optimistic, had any use for bodies like that. They were looking for visions in the arid opendown. Holes in the ground from a biblical absence of rain.</p>
        <p>The journey out was never enough on its own. What in God's dusty earthen name do we need to be bringing stuff back for? Who asked for a souvenir?</p>
        <p>I lifted a rabbit husk with the talons intact, plumped it on the mantelpiece, right above our mattress of springs, there to be considered over iced tea, plug-in fans and drawn down blinds, soon as we get back safely from the road.</p>
