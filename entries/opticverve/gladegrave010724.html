            It's hard to know what actually happens in the woods. You find things, human things, which are unclear.

            Like this shallow, grave-like hole, surely dug for fun, containing nothing. It could be an archaeological site if it weren't for the pile of earth to the side, sticks jutting from it childishly. 
        </p>
        <p>The depression in the ground looks fresh. It will be gone soon, covered by undergrowth, raked over by wind that makes its way this far through the trees.</p>

        <p>I have a not-real urge to lie down in it, just to see how it feels. I'd worry someone might see me, though there's clearly no one here, just the marks they leave.</p>

        <p>In the empty glade, I stand next to a storm toppled beech. </p>

        <p>I imagine the people who put this space in the ground. Kids, probably, but a weirdly adult thing to do. Such a neat, rectangular shape. It would have involved a level of conscious planning, roughly measured lines, a sense of form. They might return to look at their work, see how the woods have responded to it over time. If I waited here, forever, I wonder if we'd meet.</p>
