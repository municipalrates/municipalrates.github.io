    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I thought we might begin with you telling us a bit about your process.</div>
        <div class="responder">Process.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People really would like to know. I understand it's a big question, one that you've probably been asked plenty of times before.</div>
        <div class="responder">This is my first interview. I'm not sure I'm following.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Not one to follow?</div>
        <div class="responder">In relation to what, exactly?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Whatever it is you're working on. Right now. I mean, right this moment. What's in the pipeline?</div>
        <div class="responder">People aren't usually interested in that sort of thing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Since the release - the emergence, one might say - of your early tapes, audiences are starting to take more notice.</div>
        <div class="responder">Which tapes are those?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People want you to cast your memory back a bit. Give us a sense of who you were, what it felt like to be shaping sounds like that.</div>
        <div class="responder">I can't remember the tapes. I haven't made music for decades.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Those are the ones.</div>
        <div class="responder">And they've resurfaced?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Plenty of air-time in the proper circles.</div>
        <div class="responder">Fans?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Niche audiences at this stage, but who knows what might happen next?</div>
        <div class="responder">Not warped?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Things can spread, get out of hand very quickly. Next thing you know - </div>
        <div class="responder">You're everywhere at once.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I was hoping you might give us a sense of who you were back then, at that age.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm amazed they're still audible. I can remember the drawer I put them in, but not how I made them, or what they were called. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think a clear line can be drawn between those tapes and your later work / the war?</div>
        <div class="responder">I think one had a name like 'Panshaker', or 'Panscraper'.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think a clear line can be drawn between those tapes and who you once were?</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't do music any more, you see. I tried to become an architect instead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How are you finding the attention?</div>
        <div class="responder">Twilight is something I've never quite figured out.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Different paths, I suppose. Which way did you want to go, in the end?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've always wondered if any of it was worth pursuing, if anything was likely to come next.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">But can you really, with any confidence, say that you've managed to avoid clich√©?</div>
        <div class="responder">Of course there are pitfalls, of course. But overall... no...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what about your website? Your mailing list? The crowded room? Word out there is it's all looking a bit malnourished.</div>
        <div class="responder">I never got my head around what it was people actually wanted to see. Sometimes, as you get older, you realise you don't want to be yourself.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">So does it matter, then, what other people think?</div>
        <div class="responder">Not sure I follow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Did you ever have dreams of the stage? Did you ever dream about waking up onstage?</div>
        <div class="responder">I said those tapes really could have been something, and didn't believe it. Shame they surfaced so late.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They say it's easier than ever to release sound.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm an architect now, you see. Well, retired architect. When I worked it was to make sure that -</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What is the noblest profession, in your opinion?</div>
        <div class="responder">I really do think it's alright. I can't complain. I shouldn't complain.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You once described failure as being a 'large, barborous word'.</div>
        <div class="responder">People have killed for less, I'd say.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Are you sure this isn't too late for you? We're not keeping you up?</div>
        <div class="responder">I have more time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You must have more to say about that. You were so young. The young always have something to say.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm not sure at what point I put it away, out of sight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How did you make those sounds? A reviewer at the time called it subversive, like unfamiliar tundra.</div>
        <div class="responder">Play it, if you like. I'll try to keep up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">There's an animal in there somewhere, don't you think?</div>
        <div class="responder">I can't remember which speed it was originally meant to be played at.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Does a different tempo make a difference?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've been told a different tempo can make all the difference.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">It really is a great shame.</div>
        <div class="responder">The sense that whatever comes out of your mouth next, no matter how strange the shape, it's been said before, many times.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Identical. Identical. Identical.</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't understand quantum things.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Is that why you gave it up in the end?</div>
        <div class="responder">I suppose that's why I gave it up in the end. Turned my attention to other things. I gave myself up. People always need buildings. Started doing the kinds of drawing that matter.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Have you ever saved a life?</div>
        <div class="responder">It's been said that, when people listen closely, they often find themselves thinking about unfinished projects of their own.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People are coming forward to say that there's a sadness there, something about putting stuff down before it's had a chance to take off. Like a new bird.
        </div>
        <div class="responder">I should have taken more walks. It's always possible to go further afield. I think we should always be looking towards the afield.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You should never have allowed yourself to get like this.</div>
        <div class="responder">How are you supposed to start a project?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What can you tell us about the blank page?</div>
        <div class="responder">It was always the blank page. That always mattered more than anything that came next. Once you have that, you have it all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Shooting blanks.</div>
        <div class="responder">The moment a line is drawn you lose the original conception, the impossible stuff that drives the whole show, gone just as the show starts.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And you find it easy enough to carry on?</div>
        <div class="responder">Everything I've made has been sheer sheer pain. Nothing ever went up easy. Every projects means sharpening teeth and stretching limbs, not in a way that's comfortable.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">The effort?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've tried to design structures that lift people.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What about late success?</div>
        <div class="responder">Yes, I think in some small way - </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Any unexpected side-effects?</div>
        <div class="responder">They say I've ballooned these past few years. Can't stand the sight of myself. Can't stand the sight of them, either.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You never told us about your routine.</div>
        <div class="responder">I run further and slower. It feels regressive, the sort of thing children should be doing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How has it affected your family life?</div>
        <div class="responder">I never had children. Thought they'd probably end up getting in the way. Not that I think it made much difference in the end, might as well have had one or two.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They say it really does change you.</div>
        <div class="responder">Irreparably, or so I once read.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think it's about leaving behind a legacy, or is it more than that? Is there something in the act itself?</div>
        <div class="responder">My firm presented me with an award last year. It means my name goes in the company brochure. I might even get a plaque, something for future employees to remember me by, though they'll never have met me, so I'm not sure 'remember' is the right word. But it could be there for years. Just my name. Etched on a metal plate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I'm going to quote you something, and I want you to tell me what comes next -</div>
        <div class="responder">Who said this?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">"Living defensively is the central theme of our age..." </div>
        <div class="responder">"... how else can we live?"</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you remember it?</div>
        <div class="responder">"Sometimes I write in the dark. At first it would come as a shock to turn on the light and see how big all the writing looked on top of each other or falling off the page."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You can stop now, you don't need to quote any more. </div>
