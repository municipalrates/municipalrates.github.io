    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I thought you might begin by telling us a bit about your process.</div>
        <div class="responder">Process.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People really would like to know. I understand it's a big question, one that you've probably been asked plenty of times.</div>
        <div class="responder">This is my first interview. I'm not sure I follow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Not one to follow?</div>
        <div class="responder">In relation to what, exactly?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Whatever it is you're working on. Right now. I mean, right this moment. What's in the pipeline?</div>
        <div class="responder">People aren't usually interested in that sort of thing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Since the release - the emergence, one might say - of your early tapes, audiences are starting to take more notice.</div>
        <div class="responder">Which tapes are those?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People want you to cast your memory back a bit. Give us a sense of who you were, what it felt like to be shaping sounds like that.</div>
        <div class="responder">I can't remember the tapes. I haven't made music for decades.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Those are the ones.</div>
        <div class="responder">And they've resurfaced?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Plenty of air-time in the proper circles.</div>
        <div class="responder">Fans?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Niche audiences at this stage, but who knows what might happen next?</div>
        <div class="responder">Not warped?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Things can spread, get out of hand very quickly. Next thing you know - </div>
        <div class="responder">You're everywhere at once.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I was hoping you might give us a sense of who you were back then, at that age.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm amazed they're still audible. I can remember the drawer I put them in, but not how I made them, or what they were called. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think a clear line can be drawn between those tapes and your later work / the war?</div>
        <div class="responder">I think one had a name like 'Panshaker', or 'Panscraper'.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think a clear line can be drawn between those tapes and who you once were?</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't do music any more, you see. I tried to become an architect instead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How are you finding the attention?</div>
        <div class="responder">Twilight is something I've never quite figured out.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Different paths, I suppose. Which way did you want to go, in the end?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've always wondered if any of it was worth pursuing, if anything was likely to come next.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">But can you really, with any confidence, say that you've avoided clich√©?</div>
        <div class="responder">Of course there are pitfalls, of course. But overall... no...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what about your website? Your mailing list? The crowded room? Word out there is it's all looking a bit malnourished.</div>
        <div class="responder">I never got my head around what it was people actually wanted to see. Sometimes, as you get older, you realise you don't want to be yourself.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">So does it matter, then, what other people think?</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm not following.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Did you ever have dreams of the stage? Did you ever dream about waking up onstage?</div>
        <div class="responder">I pretended those tapes really meant something, but didn't believe it. Shame they surfaced so late.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They say it's easier than ever to release sound.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm an architect now, you see. Well, retired architect. When I worked it was to make sure that -</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What is the noblest profession, in your opinion?</div>
        <div class="responder">I really do think it's alright. I can't complain. I shouldn't complain.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You once described failure as being a 'large, barborous word'.</div>
        <div class="responder">People have killed for less, I'd say.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Are you sure this isn't too late for you? We're not keeping you up?</div>
        <div class="responder">I have more time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You must have more to say about that. You were so young. The young always have something to say.</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm not sure at what point I put it away, out of sight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How did you make those sounds? A reviewer at the time called it subversive, like unfamiliar tundra.</div>
        <div class="responder">Play it, if you like. I'll try to keep up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">There's an animal in there somewhere, don't you think?</div>
        <div class="responder">I can't remember which speed it was originally meant to be played at.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Does a different tempo make a difference?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've been told a different tempo can make all the difference.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">It really is a great shame.</div>
        <div class="responder">The sense that whatever comes out of your mouth next, no matter how strange the shape, it's been said before, many times.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Identical. Identical. Identical.</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't understand quantum things.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Is that why you gave it up in the end?</div>
        <div class="responder">I suppose that's why I gave it up in the end. Kicked my attention down other avenues. I gave myself up. People always need buildings. Started doing the kind of drawing that matters. Started doing things that get away with pretending to matter, without mattering at all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Have you ever saved a life?</div>
        <div class="responder">It's been said that, when people listen closely, they often find themselves thinking about unfinished projects of their own.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People are coming forward to say that there's a sadness there, something about putting stuff down before it's had a chance to take off. Like a new bird.
        </div>
        <div class="responder">I should have taken more walks. It's always possible to go further afield. I think we should always be looking towards the afield.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You should never have allowed yourself to get like this.</div>
        <div class="responder">How are you supposed to start a project?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What can you tell us about the blank page?</div>
        <div class="responder">It was always the blank page. That always mattered more than anything that came next. Once you have that, you have it all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Shooting blanks.</div>
        <div class="responder">The moment a line is drawn you lose the original conception, the impossible stuff that drives the whole show, gone just as the show starts.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And you find it easy enough to carry on?</div>
        <div class="responder">Everything I've made has been sheer pain. Nothing ever went up easy. Every project means sharpening teeth and stretching limbs, not in a way that's comfortable.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">The effort?</div>
        <div class="responder">I've tried to design structures that lift people.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What about late success?</div>
        <div class="responder">Yes, I think in some small way - </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Any unexpected side-effects?</div>
        <div class="responder">They say I've ballooned these past few years. Can't stand the sight of myself. Can't stand the sight of them, either.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You never told us about your routine.</div>
        <div class="responder">I run further and slower. It feels regressive, the sort of thing children should be doing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How has it affected your family life?</div>
        <div class="responder">I never had children. Thought they'd probably end up getting in the way. Not that I think it made much difference in the end, might as well have had one or two.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They say it really does change you.</div>
        <div class="responder">Irreparably, or so I once read.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you think it's about leaving behind a legacy, or is it more than that? Is there something in the act itself?</div>
        <div class="responder">My firm presented me with an award last year. It means my name goes in the company brochure. I might even get a plaque, something for future employees to remember me by, though they'll never have met me, so I'm not sure 'remember' is the right word. But it could be there for years. Just my name. Etched on a metal plate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I'm going to quote you something, and I want you to tell me what comes next -</div>
        <div class="responder">Who said this?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">"Living defensively is the central theme of our age..." </div>
        <div class="responder">"... how else can we live?"</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Do you remember it?</div>
        <div class="responder">"Sometimes I write in the dark. At first it would come as a shock to turn on the light and see how big all the writing looked on top of each other or falling off the page."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You can stop now, you don't need to quote any more. </div>
        <div class="responder">I can stop now, I don't need to say any more than that.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What are your hopes after death?</div>
        <div class="responder">A reasonable pension.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And your friends?</div>
        <div class="responder">Not much really, can't say I've given it too much thought. I don't like detritus.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">But what about your friends?</div>
        <div class="responder">A few of them phone me when I least expect it. Some of them have sort of dropped off.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Died.</div>
        <div class="responder">Blossom-end rot. I've read about it in gardening magazines. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Any new year resolutions?</div>
        <div class="responder">Less rice.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what about the others?</div>
        <div class="responder">Looking back, I really am far less than I've projected myself to be. In fact, it's pretty much all projection.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">So you don't consider yourself to be a musician? Everyone else sees you that way. Does that seem strange to you?</div>
        <div class="responder">I struggle to understand how the recordings still exist. I thought I saw them buried. Earth on top of earth, before my very eyes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What made you do such a thing?</div>
        <div class="responder">My parents discouraged me from pursuing a career in anything that didn't speak for itself.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Can you describe your childhood for me?</div>
        <div class="responder">I grew up around kind people who gave everything and asked for nothing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what do they think of you today?</div>
        <div class="responder">I try to call home four times a year, once a season, let them know I'm still going. We never have that much to talk about. I end up talking about myself.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They must be very proud.</div>
        <div class="responder">I never really understood pride, what it was all about. Another reason I should have had children. They teach you that sort of thing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Where are your children now?</div>
        <div class="responder">You can see what it really means to them, somewhere deep within the eyes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You mean, you don't think this is what they wanted for you, after all?</div>
        <div class="responder">They would never have allowed it. That's why it's so strange hearing those tapes now - it's a reminder of a part of me that wasn't allowed to carry on.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">What did they think?</div>
        <div class="responder">You know how a fast-moving train, whilst travelling through a tunnel, is surrounded and preceded by its own roar? Its noise becomes a separate kind of animal, fiercer than the object it was made by. It sort of overshadows everything it once depended on. I think that's the sort of thing I was trying to capture in those tapes. How am I supposed to explain that to them?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Some listeners have said it made them want to lie down and hide away under dim light.</div>
        <div class="responder">The way the noise of everything becomes too much, too fast. Yes, I can understand that.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what about endings? You've hardly mentioned endings at all.</div>
        <div class="responder">You see, that all came about as a result of something to do with my skin. I get these small bumps, kind of, like spots, but not spots, perhaps blocked pores, swollen hair follicles, who knows, you don't really notice them unless you look close, they don't itch or hurt or anything, but I can't leave them alone, drives anyone who knows me mad, they tell me off for picking at them whenever I get a chance, pinching the skin until it bruises, but I keep thinking about what's beneath the bumps, there must be something there otherwise the skin would be flat, but even if there is something there, underneath the surface, it's not worth picking at, not worth leaving a mark for, it's still just cosmetic.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You don't think the music's aged that well?</div>
        <div class="responder">Difficult to say. We live in different times. I suppose this is probably where I should say something about technology, how it's changed everything.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">How many listeners, do you think?</div>
        <div class="responder">Do you have the numbers to hand?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I want you to guess.</div>
        <div class="responder">Please, tell me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Make it up.</div>
        <div class="responder">I let a few friends listen at the time. Everything that made noise was exciting back then. I don't think anyone was that impressed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I've lost the numbers. Shame, because I think you would have been pleasantly surprised.</div>
        <div class="responder">I imagine so.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">And what's next? What can we expect?</div>
        <div class="responder">I'm going to lie down for a while. Been struggling with my balance quite a bit recently. Metaphorically speaking, you understand. I can still walk around without falling over.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I'm very sorry to hear that.</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't think I really know how to answer your question.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">In what sense?</div>
        <div class="responder">In the sense of 'Was it all worth it?'</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">That's not a question anyone has asked.</div>
        <div class="responder">I saw a funeral being conducted remotely the other day, via video-link. There were fractals of grief. The connection was weak. It was more moving because of all that, I think. Not being able to hear or see everyone properly.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">Who do you think will be there in the end?</div>
        <div class="responder">I never thought I'd make it as far as I have. I won't be leaving much behind. Buildings, unless they're cathedrals, don't tend to last more than a few generations. Songs die even younger.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">You never answered my question.</div>
        <div class="responder">Thing that struck me was how no one mentioned what the deceased did for a living. It wasn't mentioned once. People just talked about other things.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">That's all we've got time for, I'm afraid.</div>
        <div class="responder">Where did you say you found them? How did they resurface?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">They really have caused quite a stir.</div>
        <div class="responder">I don't know how I feel about all of that.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">People have talked about feeling lifted.</div>
        <div class="responder">I feel lifted.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">The path you didn't take?</div>
        <div class="responder">The one that -</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">I'm afraid that's all we've got time for.</div>
        <div class="responder">Feels strange having something break the surface.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="achievementsmainpoem">
        <div class="interviewer">We're going to have to <a href="../../index.html">leave</a> it there.</div>
