        <p id="line10">join me, cordially, for the making of a world</p>
        <p id="line11">what it will look like</p>
        <p id="line12">how 'twil heft</p>
        <p id="line13">I'm not so certain</p>
        <p id="line14">I'm hoping it will contain elements</p>
        <p id="line15">none of us have conjured yet</p>
        <p id="line16">but I have stories wriggling in the fur</p>
        <p id="line17">some of which emerged from dreams</p>
        <p id="line18">some of which emerged from neglected gardens</p>
        <p id="line19">newly pissed on</p>
        <p id="line20">the story I begin with is in no way the beginning</p>
        <p id="line21">I think of it sitting somewhere in the middle</p>
        <p id="line22">reeling out and reeling inward</p>
        <p id="line23">right there in the mess we're soon to map</p>
        <p id="line24">nets ballooning, full of phantom</p>
        <p id="line25">surfing under the eversong</p>
        <p id="line26">this is a brief tale about people following each other</p>
        <p id="line27">roundward and roundward</p>
        <p id="line28">perhaps without knowing it</p>
        <p id="line29">if one wished to attach a metaphor to these proceedings:</p>
        <p id="line30">walking panes of glass, clean or uncleaned</p>
        <p id="line31">depends on how you wish to peer through them</p>
        <p id="line32">you could also try:</p>
        <p id="line33">dirty bits of mirror, bumping into themselves</p>
        <p id="line34">or never touching at all</p>
        <p id="line35">shortly before writing this story</p>
        <p id="line36">shortly after quitting his job</p>

        <p id="line44">the author is not performing a literary feint</p>
        <p id="line45">when they speak</p>
        <p id="line46">this prelude is not a gloss on a directionless fiction</p>
        <p id="line47">wherever there is speech</p>
        <p id="line48">it is, itself, an attempt</p>
        <p id="line49">to make a bit more sense</p>
        <p id="line50">of a story emerging</p>
