        <p>Pursued by devils coming out of the ground, we flee to a winter realm that lasts far longer than anyone wants.
            <br><br>One of our party finds their long lost brother, plane-shifted from birth into a different world. He ends up leaving him there, abandoning him again. A moving point in the story.
            <br><br>I think about spending a lifetime trying to locate people lost between planes of existence, the wandering souls of children, evaporated by mage-craft.
