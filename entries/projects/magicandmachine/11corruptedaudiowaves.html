        <p>corrupted audio waves
            <br>a wave being just a fluctuating line
            <br>audio being something you can corrupt without it necessarily becoming evil
            <br>a reminder that you're listening to imitations of speech
            <br>a signal masquerading as human
            <br>
            <br>when it breaks up 
            <br>a reminder of a thin binary shell
            <br>that can't deal with heavy traffic at metropolitan intersections 
            <br>or the piling up of the conglomerate dead 
            <br>
            <br>corrupted audio waves 
            <br>are lines that make no sense in isolation
            <br>
            <br>the surf that folds in on itself with no room
            <br>to catch itself and bloom
            <br>
            <br>a wave is nothing more than a line 
            <br>that does nothing but dip and rise 
            <br>onwards and forever</p>
