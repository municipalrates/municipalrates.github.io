            I want to know what will be left behind. Tech gets ever smaller, but how far? Will nanocomputers eventually hoover up the detritus of the world and become invisible gods? Are they fairies? Are they already with us? Are they what we experience as mystical experience, as seance, as third-eye, as night hag? When we try to discern what air is made of, is that when they cloak themselves?</p>
