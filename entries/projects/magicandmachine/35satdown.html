        <p>sat down, already tired, in a modern room at the back of a long queue<br><br>

            everyone was heavy with waiting<br><br>
            
            I typed loudly to alert them to my presence<br><br>
            
            when they looked over my shoulder to read what I'd written, they saw:<br><br>
            
            'make of your baggage what you will'<br><br>
            
            and there was a ping, sound of an old coin hitting a metal basin, indication that a message had been received from somewhere, and when I opened it up I saw:<br><br>
            
            'try folding the luggage up, thin enough to fit through spaces we can't see'<br><br>
            
            and someone reading over my shoulder said:<br><br>
            
            'they're right, stuff you can send through the air is barely worth being' </p>
