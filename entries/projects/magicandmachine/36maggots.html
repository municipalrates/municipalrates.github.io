        <p>By that point, we may have been questioning whether magic had left our world. Our interest, however, was renewed when we arrived at a small town, the inhabitants of which were panicking about a hellish rift in the earth that had appeared in their corn fields overnight.</p>
        <p>The real selling point - maggots, bubbling up from the gorge and dribbling out into the crops. This was predictable demonic behaviour. We caught the flavour of it. It gave our characters new life. We knew we were dealing with a manageable devil, manageable because it chose a form we recognised.</p>
