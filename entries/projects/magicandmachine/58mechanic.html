        <p>In a flat voice the mechanic reads a long list of all the repairs he has carried out, along with the overall price. In an equally flat voice the man thanks the mechanic for all these repairs. He drives the vehicle out onto the freeway, continues for several miles, then cuts the engine at a busy intersection, abandons the car in the middle of traffic. The man is overcome by grief, but we don't learn this while he's driving. </p>
        <p>It turns out this is the car in which his wife was killed. This is the start of a film about bullying and the terrible things people do to each other. It involves distance and drowning and driving around. In the end, plenty of people abandon the methods they've been using to get through life when these methods don't seem to be working anymore. </p>
