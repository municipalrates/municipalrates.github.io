Grown men and women sitting round tables making up adventures and pretending, quite openly, to be people that they're not. Together, they create a world everyone knows never existed, within boundaries everyone knows exist, and they stoke it to ensure it stays lit.

elven woods, sacrifices, wave surfing on the river

We sat around as adults, grown adults, making up stories for another, and moving around in each other's dungeons. There were chapters during which close friends would turn into various animals, then back again into friends. There was a moment when the earth opened up to reveal maggots. There were hackneyed tropes of hell. There was bacchanalian nakedness. There was waking in the night to discover there's one more person sleeping in the room than we originally thought there was, then an interrogation of that figure to determine whereabouts its edges are, where it might begin or how we might follow it outside.

We explored a cave system in which the walls were geometric, because that's far easier to map. The traps turned out to be mechanical in nature, not organic, and that too was a disappointment. We do not descend into fantasy in order to meet new machines, but to be liberated from straight lines.

One friend put his fictional face in a mushroom and turned violent towards everyone else there. We tried tying him up, but before we'd had time to figure out the rules of how this would work, the violent fit had passed. 

We fell asleep with spores in the air, woke feeling less healthy than before.
