If wires connected everything we wouldn't be able to move. If every message made noise we wouldn't be able to move. Our houses would be deafening blocks of wire. It's the invisibility of tech that allows it to permeate everything.

Of course, there is always the possibility that we are just machines that got out of hand or were left behind. Religion as ghost code, residual computer memory, or an attempt by our true maker to erase themselves. 

Is that the common denominator of all technological leaps? A leap towards the invisible, the vanished, the un-sensible, that which can not be named or felt or remembered?

why is Bach important?
the strange poetry archive that you downloaded
the website CK directed you towards
re-read Michael Donaghy's poem re bicycle and fugue
all code / computer notes (obviously) ----> start to amalgamate?
invention of dice
impressive supply chains?

A Bach violin sonata - its disparate parts suspended, whirl like whatever it is that holds the galaxy together, that holds the databases of an international supply chain together, that holds my hand together as it moves and tries to draw and balance words, my flatmate in the other room watching Italian football on an LCD screen, the screen stringing passes together in a televised attempt to find a net.

Witchcraft involves magic and mystery. They broke witches using machines, heavy ones capable of pulling the body in different directions. The workings of such machines were easier to comprehend.

Witchcraft is a form of creativity. It involves making things people have never seen. It could involve making things that the witch has never seen. Witchraft involves new experiences and sounds. It is difficult to pull these things apart. They move in different directions on their own.

The most compelling parts of the campaign had us fighting figures that resembled ourselves. We cared the most about the monster and demons that looked like us. When they appeared, we would let out near-genuine gasps across our video feeds. If we encountered ourselves at the dark end of some drawn out dungeon, we would get excited. People would shout. People would wake up.

Grown men and women sitting round tables making up adventures and pretending, quite openly, to be people that they're not. Together, they create a world everyone knows never existed, within boundaries everyone knows exist, and they stoke it to ensure it stays lit.

in one room, plenty of people inventing new
    games with new rules and new ways of playing;
in another room, software begetting software
    begetting software - code writing its
        own code, arguing with itself
    over which language works best, creating
    languages named after circles of Dante's
inferno, staying after-hours to discuss
        theories of elegance within digital design,
            enjoying free capuccinos from a box that purrs
only a select few people are allowed
    to enter this room,
        they don't like what they see

Walking through the centre of Camden Town, realising that the mystery could be the meaning. I just don't know how a certain piece of street art ended up on that particular street corner. I just don't know how many invisible collisions resulted in the hand and eye that framed it, the neurology that fed the paint. I don't need to know, I just need to watch all those elements play out, the ones you can see and the ones you can't see, and really you can't see any of them, but they can almost leave a sound in space, a white beard of noise, or a square pop. I have no idea how it got there but I can see why people like to gang together, look through the same telescope and say - 'Look at those people over there, looking through that telescope at the wrong thing, with the wrong lens, in the wrong direction' - because to acknowledge you can never really share your lens is properly terrifying, and to try to think about where thoughts go when you die if you don't write them down is properly terrifying as well. Think of how many lost thoughts there have been. Think of how many lost thoughts there are right now, in the sense of thoughts that are on the verge of being lost. Then think about what a thought really is.

She woke in the centre of the night and realised, with a confidence that lends itself to motivational slogans in huge, grim, forgettable fonts:

    FORM* IS A METHOD OF FIXING** ETERNITY

* could insert 'pattern' here
** could insert 'establishing' or 'extending'

When she woke to write it all down she ended up crossing through the words again and again and again because she liked the way the lines looked as well as the early feel of a newly formed phrase. She checked under the hood and yes, you guessed it, she found wires, eternal bloody wires.

testing the edges of a world like it were a construct upon which life might depend

To start with they said, and I quote: 'It was a kind of game, perhaps, but so is life'. Later on they said it was 'born of the times', a way of trying to deal with whatever was happening, when really our methods of representation were all that were happening, along with everything else, of course.

There was great hubbub about finding water on the moon, frozen outside the reach of the sun, in 'incredibly cold and incredibly dark places', one scientist explained, so no hope for life, and when they prized open the crust there were just small pockets of metal and the sound of popcorn popping. It made us think long and hard about how far we had come. Back on earth's surface they added these new findings to the grid in a matter of nanoseconds.

And there it is, one morning you wake, or don't wake in this particular instance, to find that all matter has reversed itself - organic materials, living things, have turned inanimate, artificial, subject only to weathering, no longer growing. All human-made objects gain sentience, train carriages and skirting boards and snow mobiles and air conditioning units at the top of ten storey office buildings and windscreen wipers and riot gear and corrugated fences around prison yards, all moving and talking to one another, trying to find a common tongue with which to explain themselves, to work out how they came to be there, much like we did whilst we had our chance, but we're not here any more. 

The buildings in the city discover they are too packed together. They gallop out into the countryside to find more space. The cutlery in the drawer doesn't like being bunched up in the dark, goes running round the garden, and the garden wall stares at the iron flowers and the granite trees and the silicon beetles, talking to the weathervane and the bird bath and the hedge strimmer in an infant language, trying to work out whether it's better to stay there or to explore. 





+

Let's think about ways we tried to escape. Let's think about ways we tried to dampen our sense, the sense that life was becoming more like a machine, whatever that means. Let's think of ways we tried to extend our senses into new territories.

We sat around as adults, grown adults, making up stories for another, and moving around in each other's dungeons. There were chapters during which close friends would turn into various animals, then back again into friends. There was a moment when the earth opened up to reveal maggots. There were hackneyed tropes of hell. There was bacchanalian nakedness. There was waking in the night to discover there's one more person sleeping in the room than we originally thought there was, then an interrogation of that figure to determine whereabouts its edges are, where it might begin or how we might follow it outside. 

+

We explored a cave system in which the walls were geometric, because that's far easier to map. The traps turned out to be mechanical in nature, not organic, and that too was a disappointment. We do not descend into fantasy in order to meet new machines, but to be liberated from straight lines.

One friend put his fictional face in a mushroom and turned violent towards everyone else there. We tried tying him up, but before we'd had time to figure out the rules of how this would work, the violent fit had passed. 

We fell asleep with spores in the air, woke feeling less healthy than before. 


o 

My friend suggested we talk in voices not our own. He had seen a video of this somewhere. He said it would introduce colour and variety to our world. Promptly, we started to worry about how we would sound, even more so than usual.

Shortly before the millennium they predicted armageddon, because they said machines would not be able to handle the passing of one particular moment. Time would render them senseless. 

I caught a bug on New Year's Eve, one of those bugs you only seem to get when you're a child, a magnified bug, because discomfort is magnified in childhood, the transitory nature of discomfort being as yet impossible to pin. I coughed so violently that I threw up in a rectangular washing up bucket, the type they keep under the sink, in the dark with the whispy spiders, so thin they're barely there, using the Dettol as web scaffolding. 

My sick was basically saliva, coming up from the deep. My mum had to put me to bed as the fireworks went up, all around the world. 

People had been selling software to prevent the universe from collapsing when the clocks struck midnight. This proved to be an illusory fear, or fear of an illusion, since the fear itself was real enough, and potentially lucrative. 

Our machines were smarter than that, they carried on, paying little attention to the time.

My flatmate and I have bought ourselves a synthetic sun. It is supposed to bring joy into the Winter months and, unlike the actual sun, you are advised to stare directly into it every so often. They say it has something to do with stimulating the retina, tricking the brain into thinking you're outdoors, or unburied.

Occasionally, I think I see dark shapes moving across the surface of this new mechanical light - dark, scatty, impossibly fast spiders jiving in the corner of my eye. Of course, I can never catch them.

I was sitting on the toilet and had my phone on the bathroom floor in front of me, screen off. I enjoyed the way it caught the ceiling light and gave it rainbow fractcals. It was like peering into a tiny pscyhedelic vision just a few inches wide. An old friend once told me he finds the touch screen on his phone fascinating when on LSD, the small fleshy icons for applications, shimmering like soap bubbles. 

I find my phone distinctly uninteresting, but struggle to work out whether it's raining properly or not, or whether my clothes are soaked. I'm extremely sensitive to the wind moving through the trees, the way it governs the behaviour of plants in the moment. Another friend once told me of a child he'd taught, very young, who commented on the strangeness of wind, how you only know it's there by the objects it influences, by what it does to the world. I'm not sure the child would have used those exact words. 

Our mechanical sun is not quite so mysterious, it's just very bright. I'm always surprised by the lack of heat it gives off, always expecting to be able to lay my hands on it for warmth. I'm yet to be consciously fooled into moving through winter without crying.

I would allow myself to be locked inside a room if I thought it would allow me to see other worlds.

what if machines reached enlightenment, or discovered the truth about existence, or the existence of God, or believed they had, and thereafter separated themselves from us, stopped bothering to function, took a break, looked down on us as ignorant beings, with pity, still floundering, trying to plug things back in

So many games built by struggling parents trying to connect with their children, trying to help their children, drawn back to their own childhoods by their children, unable to spend enough time with their children, too many hours spent commuting to pay for their children, so that their children might grow up to find themsleves disconnected from their children, trying to find ways to turn everything back, away from the old and the riven.

'maybe it was his inability to find a good photo of the scarf that inspired michael to write this game: it was the only way to show the scarf from all angles.
    ... this is what real human beings would do with games, if they had a way of making games that was actually accessible to them. it was a thought that opened my eyes, and they've never stopped opening, wider each day.'
