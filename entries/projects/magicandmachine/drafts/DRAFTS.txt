time within the gamespan as 
bedrock time as ocean
depths of time as foam on the timed

'Mortal perhaps are their ephemeral blooms, the intricate and short-lived creations of an age, their economic triumphs and their social trials, in the short term. But their foundations remain. They are not indestructible, but they are many times more solid than one might imagine. They have withstood a thousand supposed deaths, their massive bulk unmoved by the monotonous pounding of the centuries.'

    - Braudel

'Reading about this sort of fictional world is a bit like watching someone play a board game while making up the rules: the temptation is to tiptoe quietly away and leave them to it' 

    - Rob Yates quoting Colin Burrow writing about Ursula K. Le Guin writing 'Always Coming Home'

What do skeletons of the digital age look like? Are they wired children huddling in corners, surrounded by buzz, clicks and chattering lights? Are they sceptres of aluminium puncturing the sky over flatlands in the dark, bulb on top to prevent airplanes from impaling themselves? 

Rows and rows of clever clever silicon. Cavernous intelligence. Underground or under the sea or anywhere. 

Aliens will come down to find earth stripped of all but animal life, wandering amongst the metal trees - animals that have survived because they were never made part of the network.

Two nanopods find themselves questioning whether they themselves are not being fooled. After the next Fall, they consider the possibility that humans are the ones who have achieved invisibility, or immortality. The ultimate vanishing act that marks the maker from the made. They start to worship us, now that we're no longer there. They tell stories about what we might have looked like. They tell cautionary tales about ending up in a world where we exist.

The invisible machines try to get inside the animals. 

The wise old squirrel, free, staying above ground, unplugged - it is infiltrated during hibernation. It wakes in spring to find its eyes full of data. Knowledge of all acorns in every buried hole. 

Birds prove harder to catch. The pathogen struggles to get inside them mid-flight - it has to wait for the nest, for the chicks to sprout, little electric shrubs with loud beaks.

If wires connected everything we wouldn't be able to move. If every message made noise we wouldn't be able to move. Our houses would be deafening blocks of wire. It's the invisibility of tech that allows it to permeate everything.

The next step is our brains being hooked straight into the mainframe. Old people will resist just as old people resist everything. I, too, will resist, I think. I can't wait for there to be technology for me to shun when I'm dying. I can't wait for my grandchildren to look at me and wonder how I survive unplugged, whilst they plug me in to the life support. Is that how the nanomites will get me? The nanthropocene?

Of course, there is the possibility that we are just machines that got out of hand or left behind. Religion is ghost code, residual computer memory, or an attempt by our true maker to erase themselves. 

Is that the common denominator of all technological leaps? A leap towards the invisible, the vanished, the un-sensible, that which can not be named or felt or remembered?

Hallucinogens and amphetamines as rogue pieces of code.

like a child's hand being removed suddenly from the surface of a hot stove in the middle of a cosmic tantrum - we stepped off the Â£$%@?!?

what really happens when someone decides, or suspects, that it is their job to draw connections between things? those moments where you think that patterns, illusory or not, might be the only structures out there, the only brief forms of condensation worth pursuing.

A READING LIST EMERGES

why is Bach important?
the strange poetry network that you downloaded
the website CK directed you towards
re-read Michael Donaghy's poem re bicycle and fugue
all code / computer notes (obviously) ----> start to amalgamate?
invention of dice
impressive supply chains?



o



A Bach violin sonata / partita - its disparate parts suspended, whirl like whatever it is that holds the galaxy together, that holds the database of an international supply chain together, that holds my hand together as it moves and tries to draw and balance words, my flatmate in the other room watching Italian football on an LCD screen, the screen stringing passes together in a televised attempt to find a net.

Buddha would surely have something to say about all this. He might even be surprised. 


o

Is this getting somewhere close to a conception of god that we can handle? 




o

how much of this will revolve around detail?

make a reading list? dig beneath the net - uncover new nets and try not to flounder in the panic of nets never ending, endless nets fluctuating so they become waves of net, wavenets, netwaves.
