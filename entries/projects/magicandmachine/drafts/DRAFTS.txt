'Mortal perhaps are their ephemeral blooms, the intricate and short-lived creations of an age, their economic triumphs and their social trials, in the short term. But their foundations remain. They are not indestructible, but they are many times more solid than one might imagine. They have withstood a thousand supposed deaths, their massive bulk unmoved by the monotonous pounding of the centuries.'

    - Braudel

'Reading about this sort of fictional world is a bit like watching someone play a board game while making up the rules: the temptation is to tiptoe quietly away and leave them to it' 

    - Rob Yates quoting Colin Burrow writing about Ursula K. Le Guin writing 'Always Coming Home'

What do skeletons of the digital age look like? Are they wired children huddling in corners, surrounded by buzz, clicks and chattering lights? Are they sceptres of aluminium puncturing the sky over flatlands in the dark, bulb on top to prevent airplanes from impaling themselves? 

Rows and rows of clever clever silicon. Cavernous intelligence. Underground or under the sea or anywhere. 

Aliens will come down to find earth stripped of all but animal life, wandering amongst the metal trees - animals that have survived because they were never made part of the network.

Two nanopods find themselves questioning whether they themselves are not being fooled. After the next Fall, they consider the possibility that humans are the ones who have achieved invisibility, or immortality. The ultimate vanishing act that marks the maker from the made. They start to worship us, now that we're no longer there. They tell stories about what we might have looked like. They tell cautionary tales about ending up in a world where we exist.

The invisible machines try to get inside the animals. 

The wise old squirrel, free, staying above ground, unplugged - it is infiltrated during hibernation. It wakes in spring to find its eyes full of data. Knowledge of all acorns in every buried hole. 

Birds prove harder to catch. The pathogen struggles to get inside them mid-flight - it has to wait for the nest, for the chicks to sprout, little electric shrubs with loud beaks.

If wires connected everything we wouldn't be able to move. If every message made noise we wouldn't be able to move. Our houses would be deafening blocks of wire. It's the invisibility of tech that allows it to permeate everything.

The next step is our brains being hooked straight into the mainframe. Old people will resist just as old people resist everything. I, too, will resist, I think. I can't wait for there to be technology for me to shun when I'm dying. I can't wait for my grandchildren to look at me and wonder how I survive unplugged, whilst they plug me in to the life support. Is that how the nanomites will get me? Via the hospital bed? The nanthropocene? 


+

Of course, there is always the possibility that we are just machines that got out of hand or were left behind. Religion as ghost code, residual computer memory, or an attempt by our true maker to erase themselves. 

Is that the common denominator of all technological leaps? A leap towards the invisible, the vanished, the un-sensible, that which can not be named or felt or remembered?

Hallucinogens and amphetamines as rogue pieces of code.

what really happens when someone decides, or suspects, that it is their job to draw connections between things? those moments where you think that patterns, illusory or not, might be the only structures out there, the only brief forms of condensation worth pursuing

A READING LIST EMERGES

why is Bach important?
the strange poetry archive that you downloaded
the website CK directed you towards
re-read Michael Donaghy's poem re bicycle and fugue
all code / computer notes (obviously) ----> start to amalgamate?
invention of dice
impressive supply chains?



o



A Bach violin sonata - its disparate parts suspended, whirl like whatever it is that holds the galaxy together, that holds the databases of an international supply chain together, that holds my hand together as it moves and tries to draw and balance words, my flatmate in the other room watching Italian football on an LCD screen, the screen stringing passes together in a televised attempt to find a net. 


o

Buddha would surely have something to say about all this. He might even be surprised. 


o

Is this getting somewhere close to a conception of god that can be handled? 




o

how much of this will revolve around detail?

make a reading list? dig beneath the net - uncover new nets and try not to flounder in the panic of nets never ending, endless nets fluctuating so they become waves of net, wavenets, netwaves.

Globes of creativity. Globs of creation. When you make something, think of it as an orb. Stay with me. I'm going to talk about networks, insects with infinite legs, cogs with infinite teeth.

No, the globe is better. That which is spherical and fluid is better. 

Think of a sphere, that's what you've made, but it exists in a space where everything everyone else has ever made also exists - infinite spheres - and small strands of light come from them, tendrils like the red gases and solar flares rippling out from the sun, cigar smoke. Spheres become linked to spheres through these lines, an inferno of connection. Some globes appear to swallow entire galaxies, others are like grains of sand, almost entirely isolated, unpublished poems thrown in recycling bins and never read by anyone but their maker, left to decompose, or becoming milk cartons, packing boxes, whatever old recycled paper becomes, new paper with all the old lines erased. Think of all the things people have made and remade. Think of all those spheres with their connecting lines. Scholars focus on small sections of this network, trying to figure out how things link up, how Marlowe might relate to Cuban folk music, or how violence in the 20th century might relate to Wagnerian bellows or Indian ragas or newts, Nigerian pottery to a contemporary dance show with two intervals you saw at the Southbank one evening whilst too hungover to care, light installations in New York and the first drum ever made from a frog. There are some things we'll simply never know.

steam turns colours you wouldn't predict
birdsong collapses / revives

black and white silent films become popular once again

there are lots of images of red suns and huge waves in the Pacific
islands and their humans appear like pinpricks in the hide of a vast cow 
all people can do is talk about weather patterns, not the weather itself

Witchcraft involves magic and mystery. They broke witches using machines, heavy ones capable of pulling the body in different directions. The workings of such machines were easier to comprehend.

Witchcraft is a form of creativity. It involves making things people have never seen. It could involve making things that the witch has never seen. Witchraft involves new experiences and sounds. It is difficult to pull these things apart. They move in different directions on their own.

The most compelling parts of the campaign had us fighting figures that resembled ourselves. We cared the most about the monster and demons that looked like us. When they appeared, we would let out near-genuine gasps across our video feeds. If we encountered ourselves at the dark end of some drawn out dungeon, we would get excited. People would shout. People would wake up.

Grown men and women sitting round tables making up adventures and pretending, quite openly, to be people that they're not. Together, they create a world everyone knows never existed, within boundaries everyone knows exist, and they stoke it to ensure it stays lit.

In a flat voice the mechanic reads a long list of all the repairs he has carried out, along with the overall price. In an equally flat voice the man thanks the mechanic for all these repairs. He drives the vehicle out onto the freeway, continues for several miles, then cuts the engine at a busy intersection, abandons the car in the middle of traffic. The man is overcome by grief, but we don't learn this while he's driving. 

It turns out this is the car in which his wife was killed. This is the start of a film about bullying and the terrible things people do to each other. It involves distance and drowning and driving around. In the end, plenty of people abandon the methods they have been using to get through life when the methods don't seem to be working anymore.

Some people like to test the edges of games, to see what happens at the end of the map, or when you jump at a certain time in a certain place at the same time as something else occurring.

descent into the depths of an industrial church
graves in the garden indicating you're on the right track 
sense that the drop into the heart of the machine

sat down, already tired, in a modern room at the back of a long queue

everyone was heavy with waiting

I typed loudly to alert them to my presence

when they looked over my shoulder to read what I'd written, they saw:

'make of your baggage what you will' 

and there was a ping, sound of an old coin hitting a metal basin, indication that a message had been received from somewhere, and when I opened it up I saw:

'try folding the luggage up, thin enough to fit through spaces we can't see'

and someone reading over my shoulder said:

'they're right, stuff you can send through the air is barely worth being'

At the very bottom of the cave system, after we forgot what our fictional world was supposed to look like, after it had come to seem uniform, after we forgot to ask for a description, stopped asking for commentary on what we were supposed to be seeing, after what seemed like years of living without sunlight, and in reality took many weeks to roleplay, we encountered porcelain figures, modelled on ourselves.

Promptly, they turned to flesh on our approach. Of course, a battle ensued. We had to fight out mirror images. One of the group found his doppelganger to be ferrel, roaming about on all fours, devilish eyes, casting spells none of us had seen before, like a human insect, untrustworthy, disturbed.


+ 

The imperfect, inconstant light of whatever was supposed to be casting light down there didn't really matter, because we were having to see it all in our minds. The maps we were using, computer generated for ease, were brightly lit, and though these square charts were supposed to be frames for the imaginary world to hang on, jetties from which we could dive off, they in fact bled into the world like actual scaffolding, a rigid substance spoiling the look of the original dream, something no longer flexed and morphed. We were better off without the maps. Much better never to pin anything down.

in one room, plenty of people inventing new
    games with new rules and new ways of playing;
in another room, software begetting software
    begetting software - code writing its
        own code, arguing with itself
    over which language works best, creating
    languages named after circles of Dante's
inferno, staying after-hours to discuss
        theories of elegance within digital design,
            enjoying free capuccinos from a box that purrs
only a select few people are allowed
    to enter this room,
        they don't like what they see

temptation of a completely sealed world, disconnected from the outside - the attraction being that no part of the outside world can get in - but can this hermetically sealed vessel also become claustrophobic? trapped in a bag with no safety valves?

there are laws against living as a cloud, just as there are laws against living inside clouds
there are no laws against gazing out the window of a plane and feeling like the clouds construct a separate plane of reality that you could stand on or fall through
