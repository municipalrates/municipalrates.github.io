I was drawn to the potentialities of interactive fiction before I knew what any of that / this means.

I realised that via PowerPoint you could link slides, create a map, a moving world, although one accidental mouse-click could spoil it all, and I soon realised just how many separate windows into a world you needed in order to make it work, and suddenly the limitations started to creep in.

When you plot a finite path through a world you circumscribe its limits. Describing anything can result in a signal as to where everything ends. You're no longer exploring. You're walking a very thin line, between very high walls.
