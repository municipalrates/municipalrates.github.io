        <p>
            People create videos which are just shorter videos on repeat. They're impossible to watch 
            and yet there's no doubt they mean something.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other things in the world which can't be watched, but mean something. Films reeling 
            for hours on a single frame. The oscillating movement of a single horse 
            hair at night. The gradual rhythm found at the outstretched end of a tree, with no 
            sense of the background.
        </p>
        <p>
            What might be slouching with hunched muscle and tail across the savannah, a drama 
            of invisible beasts, just the tutting back and forth of an acacia branch and teeth a few 
            inches to the left of your ear?
        </p>
        <p>You can't watch things that are only spoken about. Concepts played out in rooms you'll
             never go into, although you know they're there. 
        </p>
