        <p>Willow blossoms coming down so slow they looked... paused. I was running. I wanted to stop to see just how fixed in the air they really were. The morning was like a scene from a videogame, those motes in the morning breeze. I went as far as the golf course and returned the exact same way.</p>

        <p>We spent the rest of the morning failing to identify dogwood, learning to identify black locust instead. We pointed at turtles of ever decreasing size. The day grew hotter.</p>

        <p>In a gorge, hawks wheeled, one after the other, and one swooped down but stopped half way, suspended, like the blossoms, like the floating bodies in M. John Harrison's <i>Light</i>.</p>

        <p>In a separate gorge, the water has formed pools that are almost perfectly circular. The gradations of the land look deliberate, almost absurd. I couldn't believe it until I looked at the sign that said it was natural.</p>

        <p>We passed a man playing wood-flute in the woods.</p>

        <p>We passed more signs.</p>

        <p>We passed a sign that said 'No Swimming' unless a lifeguard is on duty, but everyone was in the water, watching the water fall.</p>
