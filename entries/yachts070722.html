            Having never understood paintings of sailing yachts, today I sat before one in meditation, the frame propped between the floor and a bricked up fireplace, and I thought about clean geometry on top of soaking chaos.

            Straight lines cutting through impossible shapes.

            I want someone to paint a ship that starts to take on the properties of the ocean. I'm not sure what that would look like. It can't merely be a pockmarking of sail cloth, or barnacles crawling up and over the keel. It has something to do with the dissolving of clinical mathematics into salt spray. A bending of lines that wanted to be infinite, but end up continuing their journey underwater, amidst bubbles and reef sharks.
